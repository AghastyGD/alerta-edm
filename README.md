## Installation and Setup Configuration

### Pre-requisites
Ensure you have Python 3xx in your machine.


1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AghastyGD/alerta-edm
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd alerta-edm
    ```
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    
    # Activate virtual environment
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # On MacOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Install the requirements:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
5. **Setup environment variables:**

    Create a .env file in the root directory to configure env variables. You can do something like this:
    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```
    and then fill theses variables with your values:
    ```bash
   # .env
    DJANGO_ENVIRONMENT= # choose between 'dev' or 'prod'
    DATABASE_URL= your_db_url # only applicable if you are in prod environment
    SECRET_KEY= your_secret_key
    BROWSER=your_browser # Currently we support only 'chrome' and 'firefox'
    ```
6. **Run migrations:**
    ```bash
    # make migrations
    python manage.py makemigrations
    
    # migrate
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
    

## Usage

### Run the server
```bash
python manage.py runserver 
```
**Only for Windows users**:

_If you face any error about `pkg_resources` module not found when executing the project, please install or upgrade setuptools:_
```bash
pip install setuptools
```
Once the server is running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser.

## Running the Scraper

### Scraper Logic

- **`core/scraper.py`**: This script is responsible for all the logic of pulling information from the programmed power outage table on the EDM website. It scrapes the data, rearranges it, and sends it to our database.

#### Custom Command: `scrap`

- **`core/management/commands/scrap.py`**: This file defines a custom Django management command `scrap`, which inherits the logic from `scraper.py`. By running this command, you can execute the scraper directly from the terminal without needing to interact with the code manually.

    To run the scraper using the custom management command, execute the following:

    ```bash
    python manage.py scrap
    ```

    This command will:
    1. Scrape the scheduled power outage data from the EDM website.
    2. Format and clean the data as needed.
    3. Insert the data into project's database.

---

#### Scraping via URL

In addition to running the scraper manually using the `scrap` management command, you can also trigger the scraping via a simple HTTP GET request to a specific endpoint.

- **Endpoint**: `/run-scraper/`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: : This endpoint triggers the same scraping process that the scrap management command does, but in a web-friendly way. It collects data from the EDM website and inserts it into the database. This is useful for automating or remotely triggering the scraper.

    **Example Request**:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/run-scraper/
    ```

    Upon hitting this endpoint, the backend will:
    1. Scrape the power outage data from the EDM website.
    2. Insert the data into the database.
    3. Return a success response if the operation was successful or an error message if something went wrong.
